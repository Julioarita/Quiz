# Quiz Answers

Here you can find all the answers to the little Quiz supplied. Regardless anything, feel free to make me any suggestion that certainly will be helpful for me, if you consider it, please.

Although it is a simple repository with a few files, I consider relevant to create a directory to each one specifically. So, in the Answer directory you can find a folder for each answer. Just to make it clearer. 

You can find a direct link to each problem if preferred.

**The repository URL is the following:**

## Some remarks you can consider relevant about the answers for each problem in particular.

The Quiz was provided with nine questions, the very first of them was my name, so it actually has eight questions to answer. I respect the questions number and leave it on directories and files. So, you'll not find 'first problem', because it is starting with second one. 

## Second Problem:

I used a simple 'for' loop. I just look at the remainder, if it is equal
to zero, then the number is a multiple.

## Third Problem:

Considering our function purpose, performing the conversion is not required 
once confirmed that is possible to perform it. Due to the fact that our return 
is a string and not the conversion properly.

The portuguese alphabet contain 26 characters, all of them included in 
ASCII table (1 byte). Starting from the decimal value 97 until to 122.

There is a piece of code that is not require, as I mentioned above, due to the
purpose of our function once the conditions length(s) + length(t) <= k and 
length(s) >= length(t) are true always will be possible to perform conversion.

## Fourth Problem:

This one was the most tricky for me. I wasn't familiar with Unit Test. 



## Fifth Problem: 


I used SQlite as interpreter of commands, but probably due to it is a simple query you can use any other SQL interpreter.

Although the problem statement declared that it should be sort by their names in alphabetical order when students 
grades (8-10) are the same but it seemed that they were sorted by opposite way in the example.
As much as I understand, alphabetical order is descending order, so first letter is A, then B, then C and so on and so forth. 

Anyway, probably it was my misunderstood but I wanted to remark it.

## Sixth Problem: 



## Seventh Problem:
I used SQlite as interpreter of commands, but probably due to it is a simple query you can use any other SQL interpreter.

In this particular problem I wasn't given with any constraints so I decided to use `UNION`
which pull out all distinct values from both tables.

# #Ninth Problem:

It could be also possible to use a 'pointer', probably that would be the
best way to do it.
But we'll be constrained to vector length, and as I wasn't given with length restriction.
Since I was not limited to the way in how to get the string, I decided to do it like so.
